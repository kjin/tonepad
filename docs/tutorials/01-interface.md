# What is Tonepad?

Tonepad is a program that allows you to write & play music using your keyboard! It features a text editor (where you'll write the songs), an interactive player, and a customization panel to control how your music is played! Briefly, these are the available components:

- **File Loader**: Load or save a file.
- **Playback Controls**: Start, stop, or seek the current song.
- **Editor Settings**: Set settings for the editor.
- **Device Selector**: Select a MIDI input or output device, or route to built-in instruments.
- **Channels**: Sample, solo, or mute channels.
- **Instrument Selector**: Select instruments that play when built-in instruments are used.
- **Console**: Reports messages from the system. Errors in your text file will appear here.

# Setting Up

To set up for these tutorials:

1. In "Device Selector", choose "[Built-in Soundfont]" as the Output Device.
2. In "Instrument Selector", choose an instrument for row 1. This is the instrument that will play for channel 1. Piano instruments are recommended for these tutorials.
3. In "Channels", click button "1". You should hear the sound of a piano when you hold it; turn up your volume if you don't hear it. Make sure the none of the other buttons (these are solo & mute) are active.

Most tutorials will contain a song. You'll be able to hear it by pressing the play button in "Playback Controls". Note that playback starts where the cursor is in the editor.
